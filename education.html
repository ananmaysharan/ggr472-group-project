        <h4>Context</h4>
        <p>Since the advent of the pandemic, inflation has sky-rocketed and hit the Canadian middle and lower class very
            hard. Food prices continue to rise as grocery chains end price freezes. These rising economic inequalities
            are evident in food services…

            It is expected that 60% more Canadians per month are expected to use food banks in 2023 (Pasieka, 2023).
            Food inaccessibility is one the rise and vulnerable populations are evidently hit the hardest.

            “More people visited Daily Bread Food Bank locations in March than at any time in the charity's 40-year
            history” - Neil Hetherington, Daily Bread Food Bank CEO

            The aim of this project is to provide a useful resource for people seeking accessible food options and
            services in Toronto. By educating the public about food insecurity and affordability in the City of Toronto,
            we hope it will aid and empower anyone trying to meet their food needs.

        <h4>Datasets and Sources</h4>

        <p>

            <strong>DineSafe Food Licensing Data (City of Toronto Open Data Portal)</strong>

            Inspection system based on governmental regulations. All drinking and dining establishments in the city need
            to comply with these regulations and continually post the most recent inspection notice near the main
            entrance.

            This database required the team to filter and delete certain fields as they were not relevant to our
            project. However, this dataset is important since any establishment in the city who wants to serve food
            needs to pass these inspections.

            <strong>Canadian Food Environment Dataset - CAN-FED (Statistics Canada)</strong>

            This dataset required filtering to get the Toronto specific data from a Canada wide data set. Afterwards, we
            were able to give the data a spatial component by joining it with Statistics Canada Dissemination Areas 2016
            Geographies Dataset
