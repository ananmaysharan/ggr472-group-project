        <h4>Context</h4>
        <br>
        <p>Since the advent of the pandemic, inflation has sky-rocketed and hit the Canadian middle and lower class very
            hard. Food prices continue to rise as grocery chains end price freezes. These rising economic inequalities
            are evident in food services…
            <br>
            <br>
            It is expected that 60% more Canadians per month are expected to use food banks in 2023 (Pasieka, 2023).
            Food inaccessibility is on the rise and vulnerable populations are evidently hit the hardest.
            <br>
            <br>
            “More people visited Daily Bread Food Bank locations in March 2023 than at any time in the charity's 40-year
            history” - Neil Hetherington, Daily Bread Food Bank CEO
            <br>
            <br>
            The aim of this project is to provide a useful resource for people seeking accessible food options and
            services in Toronto. By educating the public about food insecurity and affordability in the City of Toronto,
            we hope it will aid and empower anyone trying to meet their food needs.

            DineSafe is a food safety inspection system based on governmental regulations, that was used to source
            community kithcens and student nutrition sites. All drinking and dining establishments in the city need
            to comply with these regulations and continually post the most recent inspection notice near the main
            entrance. Any establishment in the city who wants to serve food needs to pass these inspections.

                    Environment Dataset - CAN-FED (Statistics Canada):</strong></a>

            CAN-FED is a pan-Canadian dataset of retail food environment measures at the dissemination area (DA) level
            based on food outlet data from the 2018 Statistics Canada Business Register.

            <strong> What are mRFEI and Rmix? </strong>
            <br>
            <br>

            Relative food environment variables were derived to represent the proportion of healthy and less healthy
            food retailers for each DA.

            <br>
            <br>

            The modified Retail Food Environment Index (mRFEI) calculates the proportion of food outlets that sell a
            wide selection of fresh and nutritious food that operate within each buffer and is defined using the
            following equation:
            <br>
            <br>
            \(\begin{gathered}
            \frac{(\text { chain supermarkets }+ \text { grocery stores }+ \text { fruit and vegetable markets) }}{\text
            { (chain supermarkets }+ \text { grocery stores }+ \text { fruit and vegetable markets }} \times 100 \\
            + \text { fast-food outlets }+ \text { convenience stores }+ \\
            \text { convenience stores at a gas station })
            \end{gathered}\)
            <br>
            <br>
            The fast-food restaurant mix (Rmix) calculates the proportion of fast-food restaurants relative to fast-food
            and
            full-service restaurants combined and is defined using the following equation:
            <br>
            <br>
            \(\frac{(\text { fast-food outlets })}{(\text { fast-food outlets }+ \text { full-service restaurants })}
            \times 100\)
        </p>
